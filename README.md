# Hi there, I'm Tanner 🌎 🦌  🌱
I'm currently a student studying environmental biology and geography at Ohio University. My research interests include: landscape ecology, camera traps, citizen + collaborative science, and computational ecology. In the past, I've worked on projects related to white-tailed deer and currently assist with small mammal research projects at Ohio University.

I initially fell into CS/programming through its use in GIS and ecology, but eventually found it to be a new passion I plan on continually developing as I continue towards a career in the environmental industry. So far, I've primarily worked with Python but am slowly building a proficiency in R as well.

## Current Projects:
### Scale-dependent Responses to Habitat Configuration and Fragmentation in White-tailed Deer
* My capstone research project for geography, focused on the effects of spatial scaling in ecological studies using white-tailed deer as a model.
### Hopewell Mound Group Deer Population Study
* A camera trap study looking at deer populations within Hopewell Culture National Historical Park.

## Past Projects:
### Assessing the Effects of Environmental Variables and Landscape Change on Tree Stands at The Ridges Land Lab ([repo](https://github.com/oxyppgyn/ou-field-ecology-tree-proj))
* A class project looking at the distribution of trees within the Ridges Land Lab, Athens, OH and the effects of habitat variables on tree assemblages.
### Birding Checklist for Hopewell Culture National Historical Park ([view](https://github.com/oxyppgyn/oxyppgyn/blob/7b2bf2eebe685e3046035e61cd2523549599d58f/images/HOCU%20Birding%20Checklist.pdf))
* An updated birding checklist that covers the species of Hopewell Culture National Historical Park.
* Based on a checklist dating to 1999, iNaturalist and eBird distribution data, and surveys from the NPS Heartland Network.
### Building Accessibility at Ohio University ([repo](https://github.com/oxyppgyn/ou-building-accessibility))
* A class project mapping accessibility across Ohio University's campus.
