# Hi there, I'm Tanner ðŸŒŽ ðŸ¦Œ  ðŸŒ±
I'm a recent graduate of Ohio University, where I studied environmental biology and geography. My main focus is wildlife, with a specific interest in camera traps, citizen science data, landscape ecology, and computational methods in ecology. In the past, I've mainly done projects focused on camera traps and mammal populations and hope to continue working in this general area going forward.

## Current/Upcoming Projects:
### Modeling weasel distributions in Ohio
* This is a continuing project from my time at Ohio University, focusing on determining future sampling efforts for weasels based on limited historical data/knowledge on their populations.

## Past Projects:
### Scale-dependent Responses to Habitat Configuration and Fragmentation in White-tailed Deer
* My capstone research project for geography, focused on the effects of spatial scaling in ecological studies using white-tailed deer as a model.
### Assessing the Effects of Environmental Variables and Landscape Change on Tree Stands at The Ridges Land Lab ([repo](https://github.com/oxyppgyn/ou-field-ecology-tree-proj))
* A class project looking at the distribution of trees within the Ridges Land Lab, Athens, OH and the effects of habitat variables on tree assemblages.
### Birding Checklist for Hopewell Culture National Historical Park ([view](https://github.com/oxyppgyn/oxyppgyn/blob/7b2bf2eebe685e3046035e61cd2523549599d58f/images/HOCU%20Birding%20Checklist.pdf))
* An updated birding checklist that covers the species of Hopewell Culture National Historical Park.
* Based on a checklist dating to 1999, iNaturalist and eBird distribution data, and surveys from the NPS Heartland Network.
### Building Accessibility at Ohio University ([repo](https://github.com/oxyppgyn/ou-building-accessibility))
* A class project mapping accessibility across Ohio University's campus.
