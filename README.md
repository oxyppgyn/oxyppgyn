# Hi there, I'm Tanner ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a student studying environmental biology and geography at Ohio University. I fell into CS/programming through my love of GIS and ecology. My specific interests within these fields include: spatial and movement ecology, ecological citizen science data, white-tailed deer population dynamics, and global change ecology. So far, I've primarily worked with Python, but am slowly building a proficiency in R as well.

## Current Projects:
### Debonair, a Python package (_Coming Soon!_)
  * focused on GIS and ecology data processing and management tools.
  * Debonair is planned to include: ArcGIS Portal/Online item management tools, geoprocessing tools, and GIS-related file management tools. In the future, ecology-focused content such as wildlife occupancy tools are planned to be added.
  * A standalone ArcGIS toolbox is planned to be released with most content from this package in the future. 
### NPSpecies WebMap Application
* Utilizing the NPSpecies API endpoint and providing a more user-friendly interface for location park units with certain species/taxa.
* Currently, there is no reliable method to search the database by species, and no visualization tools.
### Hopewell Mound Group Deer Population Study
* A camera trap study looking at deer populations within Hopewell Culture National Historical Park.

## Past Projects:
### Assessing the Effects of Environmental Variables and Landscape Change on Tree Stands at The Ridges Land Lab ([repo](https://github.com/oxyppgyn/ou-field-ecology-tree-proj))
* A class project looking at the distribution of trees within the Ridges Land Lab, Athens, OH and the effects of habitat variables on tree assemblages.
### Birding Checklist for Hopewell Culture National Historical Park ([view](https://github.com/oxyppgyn/oxyppgyn/blob/7b2bf2eebe685e3046035e61cd2523549599d58f/images/HOCU%20Birding%20Checklist.pdf))
* An updated birding checklist that covers the species of Hopewell Culture National Historical Park.
* Based on a checklist dating to 1999, iNaturalist and eBird distribution data, and surveys from the NPS Heartland Network.
### Building Accessibility at Ohio University ([repo](https://github.com/oxyppgyn/ou-building-accessibility))
* A class project mapping accessibility across Ohio University's campus.
